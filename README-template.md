## My process
I divided the page into three sections using sass, coded and compiled into one piece.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development
I want to focus more on centering with Grid and Flexbox;
